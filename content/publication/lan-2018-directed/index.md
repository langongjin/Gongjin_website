abstract = "A local search method is often introduced in an evolutionary optimization technique to enhance its speed and accuracy of convergence to true optimal solutions. In multi-objective optimization problems, the implementation of a local search is a non-trivial task, as determining a goal for the local search in presence of multiple conflicting objectives becomes a difficult proposition. In this paper, we borrow a multiple criteria decision making concept of employing a reference point based approach of minimizing an achievement scalarizing function and include it as a search operator of an EMO algorithm. Simulation results with NSGA-II on a number of two to four-objective problems with and without the local search approach clearly show the importance of local search in aiding a computationally faster and more accurate convergence to Pareto-optimal solutions. The concept is now ready to be coupled with a faster and more accurate diversity-preserving procedure to make the overall procedure a competitive algorithm for multi-objective optimization."
